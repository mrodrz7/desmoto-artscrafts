## Purpose and Future Edits

<p>This project was presented as a challenge by <a href="codeacademy.com">Codeacademy</a>.</p>

<p>The following materials were given:</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 images</li>
    <li>Design spec for final product</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements were to make the final product look as similar to the Design Spec as possible and to use the 4 images provided. How the site is structured and what elements I used were entirely up to me.</p>

<p>I believe this project will receive one final edit to align the descriptive text to the actual images used in the body of the website.</p>

<p>Simple and quick project with limited guidance - great for a beginner web developer!</p>
